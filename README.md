# Ace Blacklister

This is a script made for Simple Life RP.

How To:

You have to put in the spawncodes of the vehicles inside of the "blocked-models" section inside the file vehicleblacklist.lua

The different "model" selections are all seperated. 

So, 

hillf.bypass3 does NOT get the bypass2. 



To set it up so a group get's several bypasses you have to assign them to the group like this

add_ace group.admin hillf.bypass
add_ace group.admin hillf.bypass2

If not they are blacklisted for everyone.
